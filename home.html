Very softly, but very swiftly, last, the man with grey face and the staringeyes, bolted for his life,<p>
down and away from the white house. Once in the road, free from the fields and brakes, he changed his<p>
run into a walk, and he never paused or stopped, till he came with gulp of relief into the ugly <p>
streets of the big industrial town. He made hi way to the station at once, and found that he was an hour<p>
too soon for the london express. so, there was plenty of time for breakfast; which consisted of brandy.<p>
